# Coding1
A collection of files from my class Coding 1 in the Spring of 2023. Files also exist at https://replit.com/@CooperCrawford2

In week 3 we built a program that uses variable to roll dice for an Adventure. [Run it here](https://replit.com/@CooperCrawford2/Battle-of-the-Bears-Adventure?v=1)

In week 7 we rebuilt the adventure program functions for cleaner code. [Run it here](https://replit.com/@CooperCrawford2/Adventure-2-Electric-Bugaloo?v=1)

In week 12 we built a program that creates classes with functions to interact with each other. [Run it here](https://replit.com/@CooperCrawford2/DadJokes?v=1)

In week 13 we built a program that wrote to and read from files. [Run it here](https://replit.com/@CooperCrawford2/HeadersAndSource?v=1)

In week 14 we built a program that creates and loads a text file to an array. [Run it here](https://replit.com/@CooperCrawford2/GameListWithFile?v=1)
